<h3 align = "center" style = "color: green;"><u>THE TART HISTORY</u></h3> 
<p><u>The French word tarte can be translated to mean either pie or tart, 
    as both are mainly the same with the exception of a pie usually covering 
    the filling in pastry, 
     while flans and tarts leave it open.
    Tarts are thought to have either come from a tradition of layering food, 
    or to be a product of Medieval pie making. Enriched dough (i.e. short 
    crust) is thought to have been first commonly used in 1550, 
    approximately 200 years after pies. In this period, they were viewed as 
    high-cuisine, popular with nobility, 
    in contrast to the view of a commoners pie. While originally savoury, with 
    meat fillings, culinary tastes led to sweet tarts to prevail, 
    filling tarts instead with fruit and custard.Early medieval tarts generally 
    had meat fillings, but later ones were often based on fruit 
    and custard.</u></p>
